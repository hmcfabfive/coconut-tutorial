## Functionality

#### Rewritten tutorial steps

The Coconut tutorial content was rewritten so first-time users would find it easy to understand. It is split up into different sections and pages that introduce the basics of Coconut to a user before jumping into more complex case studies. The tutorial content is also interactive.

#### Copying Code into the Interpreter

The tutorial can copy code into the interpreter for the user. The user just needs to click on a code snippet and it will be copied into the interpreter.

#### Gitter
Gitter is a chatroom service for Github users. Coconut has a Gitter chatroom that gives Coconut users a way to talk to Evan Hubinger, Coconut's creator, directly. The chatroom can be accessed by clicking the tab at the bottom right of the page.

These are the html files for the tutorial pages, the css styling files for the website and for functional elements of the tutorial, and the javascript files that help run additional functionality in the tutorial website.

#### gh-pages

This branch is where the files for the live version of the new Coconut tutorial reside. It is similar to the master branch, however it is updated less often and only when major changes to the interface have been polished and finalized.

#### tutorials

This branch is devoted to the content of the tutorial. It contains Markdown files with final written versions of the tutorial content.
